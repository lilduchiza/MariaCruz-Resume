        <p class="lead mb-4">Maria Cruz is a second-year Linguistic student at the University of California Riverside. Previously Maria interned at the Alliance Mentorship Program where she helped some of the incoming  Freshman students adapt and learn about their new environment.  Maria will be graduating from the University of California Riverside in 2023 with a dual degree in Linguistics and Spanish Language. Currently, Maria is working as a cashier at a supermarket while continuing her studies. Some of her responsibilities as a cashier include greet customers in Spanish and English, help customers shop with ease, provides a positive customer experience with fair, friendly, and courteous service. Registers sales on a cash register by scanning items, itemizing, and totaling customers' purchases. Resolves customer issues and answers questions. Bags purchases if needed. Before working as a cashier at a supermarket Maria helped her grandfather in their family business after school. <br><br>
        Before, attending the University of California of Riverside Maria was a semifinalist of the Posse Foundation that identifies, recruits, and trains individuals with extraordinary leadership potential. Posse Scholars receive full-tuition leadership scholarships from Posseâ€™s partner colleges and universities. In addition, Maria completed over 100 hours of community service in hopes of giving back to her community. Maria is currently majoring in Linguistics however she plans on minoring in the Spanish Language. Prior to becoming a mentor at the Alliance Mentorship Program Maria was originally a mentee and received help from her mentor during her first year at the University of California Riverside. During her internship at the Alliance Mentorship Program, some of Mariaâ€™s responsibilities included share with a mentee (or protege) information about her own career path, as well as provide guidance, motivation, emotional support, and role modeling. In addition, She helped with exploring careers, setting goals, developing contacts, and identifying resources. Through this experience, Maria was able to achieve Leadership skills and responsibility.<br><br>
        Although, Maria has yet to get a job that is correlated to her studies she is very passionate and looks forward to attaining a job in the Linguistics field. Maria is very passionate about Learning and getting hands-on experience in the Linguistics field as she believes that Languages are a very important form of communication that allows us to connect with people from all over the world. She believes that by looking deeper into languages we can know much more about our cognition in general. Maria is fluent in Spanish and English and is currently studying Korean and plans on studying Russian, Mandarin, Arabic, and German. Mariaâ€™s goal is to become a polyglot and be able to travel and use her fluency to help others. Maria plans to travel abroad to practice the languages she is learning and  Studying abroad will help me contextualize my potential contributions to Liiniggguistics studies within an international context. Some of Mariaâ€™s personal favorite hobbies outside of learning about Linguistics is learning languages, painting, drawing, swimming, and watching true crime tv shows. Maria hopes to finish studying and graduating within the four-year plan and gt a job as a translator
